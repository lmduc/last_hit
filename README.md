# LastHit

You finish your features, push code to test servers and they fails after centuries wating? This gem will reduce your waiting time by running only relevant tests in your current branch before pushing. Then you can fix failed tests right before pushing them to the test server.
Currently, this gem works with GIT and rspec. In the future, the gem will support other Version Controls and other test frameworks.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'last_hit', group: :development
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install last_hit

## Config

Run the command `last_hit init` to generate the config file for the gem. By default, the config file is `./last_hit.yml`. You can set the path to the config file by attaching `-p [path]` to the command. For more information, please run `last_hit --help`.
